# Task 5 â€“ Roll-Number based Discount System

This project is a web application that allows users to select products, apply discounts based on their roll number, and use promo codes for additional discounts. The application dynamically calculates the final price based on the selected products and applied discounts.

## Features

- **Product Selection**: Users can select products and specify quantities.
- **Roll Number Discount**: Discounts are applied based on the middle two digits of the roll number.
- **Promo Codes**: Users can apply promo codes for additional discounts.
- **Sort Products**: Products can be sorted by price (low to high, high to low).
- **Clear Selection**: Users can clear their product selections.
- **Reset Form**: Users can reset the form to its default state.

## Files

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that contains the structure of the webpage.
- `style.css`: The CSS file that styles the product selection and discount application interface.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file that handles product selection, discount calculation, and DOM manipulation.
- `image.png`: An image file used in the project.
